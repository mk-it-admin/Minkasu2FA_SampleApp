//In React Native 0.72, we've changed the config loading setup for Metro in React Native CLI. The base React Native Metro config is now explicitly required and extended here in your project's Metro config file, giving you full control over the final config. In addition, this means that standalone Metro CLI commands, such as metro get-dependencies will work. We've also cleaned up the leftover defaults.
